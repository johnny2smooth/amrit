## ¡Feliz cumpleaños, Amrit

I am so happy to be sharing today with you. I know how much your birthday means to you, and I am so glad that I get to be a part of it for three years in a row! I know that you don't want anything besides a nice note, so here is the note (with an extra special Johnny touch on it). Instead of being composed with paper and a pen like usual, I wanted to write this one in code. Although it is only a note right now, I want this to become a place where many more notes are written. My gift to you is a note that will grow with you.

### This will take a while to perfect

And I want to get your input on how to make it better. Let me know what you like, and what you don't like. We can go from here.

```css
Happy birthday, Amrit.
You are so loved.
```
